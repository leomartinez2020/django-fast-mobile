        <h1>Percolation</h1>
        <p class="info">
          Percolation is the process of a liquid passing through a medium that has empty spaces inside. In order to
          simulate percolation we can use the Monte Carlo method in which there is initially a grid of blocked square
          sites. As the simulation proceeds, blocked sites are opened and they get filled if they have contact with
          the surface above. When a site at the bottom gets filled we say that the system percolates. A system
          percolates when approximately 60% of the sites are open. Percolation is also known as a phase transition.
          In the graphic above, there is a 20x20 grid of squared sites where the blue sites percolate, the white sites are empty, and the grey ones are blocked.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          Percolation is a case in algorithm theory of dynamic connectivity where the data structure keeps
          information about the components that are connected. Connected components have the same root in a graph.

        <h1>Langton's Ant</h1>
        <p class="info">Langton's ant is a cellular automaton where the color of the cell changes depending on the ant's movement.
           After more than 10'000 steps of chaotic movement, the ant describes a repetitive pattern.
           According to Wikipedia:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
          Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex
          emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white
          cells. The universality of Langton's ant was proven in 2000. The idea has been generalized in several
          different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states.

        <h1>Cellular Automata</h1>
        <p class="info">
          Stanis≈Çaw Marcin Ulam was a polish nuclear physicist who discovered the Monte Carlo method and cellular 
          automata, among other achievements. The idea of a cellular automaton came up from thinking about the
          growth of crystals as self-replicating robots. A cellular automaton system consists of a grid of
          cells that have certain mutable state. The cellular automaton showed here was mentioned by Stephen Wolfram
          in his book <i>"A new Kind of Science"</i>.

        <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
        <p class="info">
            Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that loops through the array, compares elements and
            swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Here the larger elements "bubble" to the top. There are
            more efficient sorting algorithms.
